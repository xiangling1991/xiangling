The official repository of sample projects and example code featured in
[Clojure Programming](http://www.clojurebook.com).

**Please note that this repo is in flux**.  We have moved all of the
code from the book and the sample projects over from O'Reilly's
repository.  The REPL interaction files for each chapter might come in
handy if you are working from the print book, but still want to
copy/paste code into a REPL; the projects from each chapter are
self-contained examples highlighting different aspects of working with
Clojure in different domains.

You can take a look at the issues on this repo to get a sense of what's
left to be done.  If you see any problems, by all means submit a new
issue.

Of course, please feel free to watch this repo, [follow @ClojureBook on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/ClojureBook), or subscribe to the book's
mailing list on [clojurebook.com](http://clojurebook.com) to be notified
when significant changes and improvements happen here.
